- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmk007
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, visualization and machine intelligence applications to financial data analysis of large public health projects.
- 🌱 Hsitorically, I've been using Excel, Tableau and PowerBI. However, have been shifting toward Python with focus on Pandas, time series analysis and
associated visualizations. I've experimented with Orange Data Science and am impressed with the "rapid analysis" that the package confers over traditional code writing. 

Challenges that I'm encountering include diversity of visualization packages available in Python and the apparently different approaches they take, where 
they excel and where they are limited. PowerBI appears to excel in this area, but the requires "dashboard" approach to data analysis.

Indeed, initially I had embarked on a "dashboard"-orientation to presenting information/analyses, but have discovered that it requires a level
of read engagement that may not always hold true. This can be especially true with "senior" level individuals. In fact, some
folks have requested training as the dashboards are beyond their confort-zone. This has led to a more "storytelling" approach to presenting information through a Jupyter Notebooks  in which information is presented in a more narrative and predigested manner with no assumption of the user interacting more than reading and understanding the information presented.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on :
1. Data analysis in relation to financial and other information associated with large public sector health projects;
1. Use of Python, Pandas, Orange to analyze and visualize such datasets;
1. Understand resources available to organize and create historical datasets of this information for later analysis.
1. Approaches to integrating/linking non-financial information (development indicators, KPIs and risks) into historical data to help identify and elaborate on narratives.
1. Alternative information presentations than dashboards - specifically those associated with a more narrative approach.
- 📫 How to reach me. I can be reached through GitHub or email at kennedyj at who.int
