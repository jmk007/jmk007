- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmk007
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, visualization and machine intelligence applications to financial data analysis of large public health projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently hsitorically been using Excel, Tableau and PowerBI. Over the past year I've concentrated on Python with focus on Pandas, SciKit-Learn, time series analysis and
associated visualizations. Last year I've also experimented with Orange Data Science as it appears to hasten the development of visual analyses of information.
Challenges that I'm encountering include diversity of visualization packages available in Python and the apparently different approaches they take, where 
they excel and where they are limited.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on :
1. Data analysis in relation to financial and other information associated with large public sector health projects;
1. Use of Python, Pandas, Orange to analyze and visualize such datasets;
1. Understand resources available to create historical datasets of this information for later analysis.
1. Approaches to integrating/linking non-financial information (development indicators, KPIs and risks) into historical data to help identify and elaborate on narratives.
- 📫 How to reach me. I can be reached through GitHub or email at kennedyj at who.int
